building easy bookworm, version 2.101, easy.sfs is too big for the 639MB 1st partition.
so far have been using easy-skeleton-amd64-1280mb.img.gz, with 1MB gap, 639MB vfat 
partition, 640MB ext4 parttition. total size of img file 1+639+640, +1 on the end
= 1281MB

for easy bookworm, change vfat partition to 767MB, ext4 partition to 4MB
total size 1+767+4 +1 = 773MB 
file: easy-skeleton-amd64-772mb.img
...proposing to not compress it!
