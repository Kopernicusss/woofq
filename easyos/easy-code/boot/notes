initrd-tree/skeleton/containers/ssh0/.session/etc/shadow
...have changed root password to "ZcP0Wx1q"
(that has numerical 0 and 1)

initrd-tree/skeleton/containers
-------------------------------
skeleton folder contents gets copied to the working-partition by initrd-tree/init
when working-partition is created.

Some containers are pre-created, and rootfs-skeleton/usr/share/applications/
has menu-entries for these (exception is ssh0), example ec-seamonkey.desktop
and ec-sh0.desktop.

rootfs-complete/usr/sbin/fixmenus generates the menu for jwm (and other window
managers). This will read the *.desktop files.
fixmenus is called from buildeasydistro, or if a cross-build, from /etc/rc.d/
rc.sysinit at first bootup of the build.

Note, fixmenus also gets called from /usr/sbin/quicksetup when locale is changed.

During runtime, if /usr/local/easy_containers/easy-containers creates a new container,
it also creates a *.desktop file, and will have to call fixmenus.
