the pre-created containers, 'console' 'desk' 'www'
do not need backup icons, as they are baked into easy.sfs,
in /usr/local/lib/X11/pixmaps/ec-www48.png etc.

...these icons are created by 3buildeasydistro

rootfs-skeleton/root/Choices/ROX-Filer/globicons and PuppyPin
have the entries for the pre-created desktop container icons.

pre-created menu entries are in rootfs-skeleton/usr/share/applications

PuppyPin runs pre-created scripts rootfs-skeleton/usr/sbin/ec-chroot-console, etc.
