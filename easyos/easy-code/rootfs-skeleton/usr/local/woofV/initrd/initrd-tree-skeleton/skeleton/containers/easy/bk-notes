.sessionSKEL/etc/xdg/templates/_root_.jwmrc is modified, as inside container.
"<!-- EC " shows sections removed.

Also, some of the usr/share/applications/*.desktop need to be removed.
.sessionSKEL/usr/bin/desk gets called when 'ec-chroot-desk' is run in host,
this will delete some .desktop files and run 'fixmenus'.

very strange, desk container starts ok from a terminal, running 'ec-chroot-desk',
and from jwm menu, however from "desk" icon on desktop fails -- either jwm fails
or rox is messed up.

couldn't fix, so 'ec-chroot-desk' now runs "urxvt -name ecxephyr ...", and /root/.jwmrc
has specified this window name "ecxephyr" is hidden.
ref: /etc/xdg/templates/_root_.jwmrc

------
SFS files now have startup scripts in /.control
For "easy", easy.sfs already has the appropriate startup script, /.control/easy
Note that these startup scripts were created by 3buildeasydistro.
Note also, when someone creates a SFS using 'dir2sfs', that script creates
the startup scripts.

"easy" container gets renamed to "pyro" or "buster" in 3buildeasydistro (woofQ).
Also, the launch script /usr/sbin/ec-chroot-easy gets renamed.
This is done so that there is no conflict if have both pyro and buster 
containerized-desktop icons on the desktop.

note: awhile back, ec-chroot-desk.desktop renamed to ec-chroot-easy.desktop
