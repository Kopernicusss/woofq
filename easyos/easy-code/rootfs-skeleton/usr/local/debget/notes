--------
want to work with debian 'apt' and 'dpkg'

could be running a pup built from debian pkgs, or a pup built
from some other pkgs.

first case, /etc/DISTRO_SPECS has DISTRO_BINARY_COMPAT and DISTRO_COMPAT_VERSION
then set apt and dpkg to use that.
otherwise, choose debian bullseye
see script 'setup-apt'
