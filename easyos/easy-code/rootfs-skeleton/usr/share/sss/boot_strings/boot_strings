[general]
#the boot-partition may have Syslinux and reFind config files.
#if so, there are strings that can be translated.
#note, when there is a locale change, QuickSetup will call lang2initrd which
# will call fixboot, which will translate files in the boot-partition.
#Please type translation only between the last two % characters. For example: s%"done"%"fertig"%
#Keep all formatting exactly the same, that is retain all " ' < > / \ characters.
# -- do not replace the " and ' with left-side or right-side quote characters.
#Keep all variables as-is, exs: ${DROPOUT} $DROPOUT -- do not translate!
#Note: do not use UTF-8 characters in these boot manager menus.
