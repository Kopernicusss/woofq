#sudo does not work. something to do with busybox mkpasswd now using sha512?
#whatever, if a script has this (ex: /usr/sbin/bootmanager):
# WHOIAM="$(whoami)"
# [ "${WHOIAM}" != "root" ] && exec sudo -A ${0} ${@}
#use busybox 'su' instead. 'su' does not read pw from stdin, but via
#the 'script' utility it works. ref:
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19164222/su-pass-password-to-script
#note, /usr/bin/sudo does not have to be suid.
