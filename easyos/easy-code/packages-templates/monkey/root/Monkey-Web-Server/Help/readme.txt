Monkey Web Server 0.9.1

There is a Monkey icon in my-roxapps.

Click the icon to run (installs automatically).
Right click the icon for Help.
You can drag the icon to the desktop to make a shortcut.

The Monkey files are in /root/monkey

The web files are in /root/monkey/public_html

Configure Monkey by editing /root/monkey/conf/monkey.conf

You can see your server here:
http://127.0.0.1/

Replace 127.0.0.1 with your own IP address
when you give people the IP address of your server.
You can get your ip here:
http://www.whatismyip.com/

If you have a firewall, you need to open the port your server uses.
If you have a router, you need to forward the port your server uses.

Monkey will run as user "nobody", not as "root"

To uninstall:
Delete the Monkey icon in my-roxapps
Delete the monkey folder in /root, if you want.
