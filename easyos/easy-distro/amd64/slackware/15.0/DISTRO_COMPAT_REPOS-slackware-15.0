#where to download the compatible-distro pkgs databases from.
#first field is for testing the url.
#second field is full URI of the database file.
#third field is name of db file when local and after being processed into standard format

# NOTE added ftp.osuosl.org for patches as it's the official changelog site. It does not contain dependency info.
# The rationale behind this decision is that only security fixes are posted and they are compiled against the original libs where possible
# so any deps needed should already be in place. Have changed this to be first repo searched, that way at any time an up to date slacko is built.
