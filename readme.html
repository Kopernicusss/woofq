    <h1>woofQ <br>
    </h1>
    <p>woofQ is a build system for creating EasyOS. Also, historically,
      for creating Quirky Linux and "classical Puppy Linux".</p>
    <p>The build systems for Puppy Linux started back in the early
      2000's, with the name "Puppy Unleashed", then became "Woof", then
      "Woof2". Circa 2013, Barry Kauler stepped down from leading the
      Puppy project and handed it over to the Puppy-community. Woof2 was
      forked to "Woof-CE", where the "CE" means "Community Edition".</p>
    <p>Barry continued to work on an experimental distribution named
      "Quirky Linux", and created the woofQ build system for that,
      derived from Woof2.</p>
    <p>In 2017, Barry started another experimental distribution, named
      "EasyOS", also built with woofQ.</p>
    <p>Note that woofQ has retained the ability to build a Puppy Linux,
      with the infrastructure as Puppy was in 2013. Hence, this is
      referred to as a "classical" Puppy.</p>
    <p>woofQ, as per the other woof* build systems, is able to import
      binary packages from anywhere. For example, the binary packages of
      Debian, Ubuntu, or Slackware, can be used.</p>
    <p>Also, binary packages compiled from source by T2sde or
      OpenEmbedded/Yocto (OE) can be imported.</p>
    <p>The current Dunfell-series of EasyOS is built from packages
      compiled in OE, see the project here:</p>
