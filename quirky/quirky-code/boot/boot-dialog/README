Boot image
----------

files with .16 extension can be opened in mtPaint by changing the extension
to .lss -- but Rox does not have a mime-type for them.

boot.msg has codes to select text colors, but note that the set of colors
to choose from is in sandbox3/build/logo.16 -- the colors
in this file are diferent from the original image as 3builddistro processed
the image and added text to it.

May 2009, the logo.16 has:
0a orange
08 very pale blue
01 almost white

logo1.gif was converted to logo1.16 by the 'gif2lss' utility.

logo1.gif and logo1.16 have 16 color palette however one color (15, where
numbering is 0 - 15) is unused. This is important, as 3builddistro will
use this unused palette entry for the text.

Hint: if you use mtPaint or other paint program to create the .gif splash
image, reduce the palette to 15 colours only. Then increase it to 16.
That way, you will get the extra unused colour.

There is now a generic mechanism in script 3builddistro.
A file named ${DISTRO_FILE_PREFIX}-splash.gif will automatically be used
as the boot splash image.

Note also, there is a similar mechanism for the Puppy logo, see
rootfs-skeleton/usr/share/doc/puplogos.
