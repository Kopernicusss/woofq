This folder is a work-area to create a self-extracting archive, and
executable named 'installquirky.run', that extracts itself and automatically
runs.

Quirky already has /usr/sbin/installquirky, however that will only work in a
running Quirky. Even other Puppy Linux and derivatives such as fatdog64 are
missing some required utilities.

installquirky.run has all the "missing" utilities inside it, thus should run
on most Linuxes.

installquirky.run is to be deployed on the Internet, wherever Quirky (and
derivatives) are hosted for download.
