Hi, I am Barry Kauler, the original developer of the cutDISTRONAME Operating System.<br>
<br>You are going to be amazed at the quantity and quality of
applications in such a tiny Linux 'distro', as well as blown away by
the speed and stunned by the ease-of-use.<br>
<br>
My aim is for cutDISTRONAME to become a no-brainer to use (ie, no need to read
the
manual!). Just turn on the PC, and off you go... we're not there yet,
as some
configuration files may have to be edited, plus various apps have to be
"tweaked". Maybe some of your PC hardware doesn't work --
in that case, first browse through the online documentation, then
search the Puppy Discussion Forum -- as a last resort, post a question.<br>
<br>
I would like to very briefly acknowledge all the guys whose programs I have
used in cutDISTRONAME. Truly, I am standing on the shoulders of many others to reach
this new pinnacle that is the achievement of cutDISTRONAME. I have acknowledged
people throughout the documentation and on the web, and my profuse gratitude
goes out to all you guys who code just because you love doing it. I would
also like to send out a special thank-you for the help received from the guys
on the Puppy Discussion Forum.

<h2>cutDISTRONAME help</h2>
All cutDISTRONAME's local documentation is in HTML or plain text format and located in
/usr/share/doc. This page is the master index.<br>

<p><br>
Note that although cutDISTRONAME has Busybox, which is a very small toolkit of
utility applications, in some cases they do not have the required
functionality and are replaced by the full versions. These replacements
include: modprobe, cat, cp, gzip, gunzip, losetup, ls, mkdir, mv, rm,
sed, sort, tar, wget,
date,
find, grep, fgrep and egrep.<br>
</p>

<p>Note that cutDISTRONAME applications are open source and under various GPL licences, however there are a few exceptions. <br>
</p>
<p>Planmaker Free
Edition (spreadsheet editor) and Textmaker Free Edition (wordprocessor) are PET packages. The licence
document is included in the packages.
We need to be able to open
and edit Excel-format spreadsheets, which Planmaker does admirably, and
the
Free Edition is just that, free, no embedded adverts, no usage
restrictions (except for a limited maximum size that can be edited).
I would like to do the right thing by the developer, Softmaker
Software,
though, and recommend that you consider the full edition if Planmaker
is to
be used for serious commercial purposes.</p>
<p>
Some releases of cutDISTRONAME have the Opera web browser, which is closed source but free.<br>
