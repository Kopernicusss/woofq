[general]
#3buildistro script in Woof separates out the sections into separate early-boot translations.
#for example the [init] section becomes file /locales/de/init in the initrd, and 
#the target file (that gets translated at bootup) is /init (the init script translates
#itself at startup, and knows where the translation files are located).
#Please type translation only between the last two % characters. For example: s%"done"%"fertig"%
#Keep all formatting exactly the same, that is retain all " ' < > / \ characters.
# -- do not replace the " and ' with left-side or right-side quote characters.
#Keep all variables as-is, exs: ${DROPOUT} $DROPOUT -- do not translate!
#140119 [init] category removed, no longer any initrd.

[boot.msg]
#3builddistro (in Woof) reads this section and translates the first bootup splash screen,
#if a non-English build of Puppy. This will be file 'boot.msg' in the live-CD.

[help.msg]
