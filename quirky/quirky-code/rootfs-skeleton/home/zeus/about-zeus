'zeus' is intended to be used inside containers, to prevent access to files, 
folders and devices by the "crippled" root user.

By default, zeus has no password, however, in EasyOS, when a password is entered
at first bootup (primarily to encrypt the working-partition), this password is
also applied to zeus.

In EasyOS, as inherited from Puppy Linux, the user runs as root, with the option
of running some Internet apps (such as the web browser) as user 'spot'.
In a container, the user is still 'root', however severely constrained by the
(optional) dropping off all Linux Capabailities.

This dropping of Capabilities means that 'root' no longer has automatic rights
to read/write/execute any file/device, instead is just like any other non-root
user. For example, if a file owned by 'zeus' has permissions 644, then 'root' 
inside the container will only be able to read that file, not write or execute.

Note, it is not just 'zeus', any user, such as 'spot', has this capability to
lock out 'root'.
